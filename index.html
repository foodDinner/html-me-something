                    So for Cybersecurity Awareness Month I started a fake phishing campaign at work.
                    This image shows the number of user who have opened the phishing email, the number of users
                    who opened the email AND clicked the link, and finally the number of users who did the previous
                    two actions and actually entered credentials into a fake web page. It's worth mentioning that
                    the data is slightly skewed as our spam filter analyzes links and thus we're getting a bit of a
                    false positive for the 'Click Link' data point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on remediation at the end of the week, then continue with a new phishing campaign
                    each week during the entire month of October. Ideally I'll see the number of users who 
                    are fooled trend downward!

                        I guess you guys probably want one me to add one more thing? How about some weird div action with crazy backgrounds and nonsensical formatting?
                        How does this salmon backgronud suite you? Personally? Ew, gross.
